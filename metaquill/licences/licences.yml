Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1.  Definitions.

          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

          "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
          the copyright owner that is granting the License.

          "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
          other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
          control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
          "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
          exercising permissions granted by this License.

          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
          including but not limited to software source code, documentation
          source, and configuration files.

          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
          and conversions to other media types.

          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
          and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2.  Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:

          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.

      5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n   meet the following conditions:\n\n   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n       stating that You changed the files; and\n\n   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n       the Derivative Works; and\n\n   (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You\n   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4.

The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or

         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

      --- LLVM Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----

      As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions

      conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and
      prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n   the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n   comment syntax for the file format.

You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

                              http://www.apache.org/licenses/

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         as of the date such litigation is filed.

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         as of the date such litigation is filed.

             the Derivative Works; and

             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                              http://www.apache.org/licenses/

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.
